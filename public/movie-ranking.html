<h3>1. The School of Rock (2004)</h3>
<p>ah, the classic musical movie featuring Jack Black, it's funny, light, have a good build up
                and payoffs. Definitely recommended!

<h3>2. The Lord of The Rings - The Return of The King</h3>
<p>one of the best movie masterpiece of all times. I only liked the last one though, because they're featurimg good war scenes,
                tense moments and many more!
